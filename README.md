# Rohi Safed

Rohi safed (роҳи сафед) is a roadmap tool that only needs a webserver serving static files. This is my first application using typescript and d3js. Any suggestions are welcome.

Try it on [hdevalke.github.io/rohisafed](https://hdevalke.github.io/rohisafed). No data is shared with some server.

## Build

```sh
npm install
npm run build
```

The results are in the `./dist` directory.

## Development

```sh
npm start
```
